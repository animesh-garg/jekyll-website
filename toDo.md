To DO for jekyll-website
==============

1. Add Class Projects along with reports in reserach section
2. Add List of courses. Possibly under research as a folder. It would be one big static file rather than posts. 
3. Remove Fun, Links and Colophon. 
4. Add colophon to bottom of the page. 
5. Fix the navigation on research page.Issue: When one navigates to a post within the research directory, there is no link to come back to the directory. 
Possibly solution fix nav.js
