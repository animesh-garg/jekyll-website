To DO for jekyll-website
==============

1. Add Class Projects along with reports in reserach section
2. Add List of courses. Possibly under research as a folder. It would be one big static file rather than posts. 
3. Remove Fun, Links and Colophon. 
    Aggregate them into one page 'More'
4. Add colophon to bottom of the page. 
5. Add a page People with all the collaborators with pictures. 
6. Add a mode for auto deployment instead of havin gto copy over the files.
7. Fix the navigation on research page.
    Issue: When one navigates to a post within the research directory, there is no link to come back to the directory. 
    Possibly solution fix nav.js
