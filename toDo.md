To DO for jekyll-website
==============

1. Fix the navigation on research page.
Issue: When one navigates to a post within the research directory, there is no link to come back to the directory. 
Possibly solution fix nav.js 

2. Add Class Projects along with reports in reserach section

3. Add List of courses. Possibly under research as a folder. It would be one big static file rather than posts.
