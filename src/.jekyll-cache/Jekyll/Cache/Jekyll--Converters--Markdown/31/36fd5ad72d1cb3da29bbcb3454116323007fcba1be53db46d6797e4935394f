<hr />

<p>Surgical tasks, whether robotic or manual, are hard and often tedious. 
Automating repetitive surgical subtasks such as suturing, cutting and debridement can reduce surgeon fatigue and procedure times and facilitate supervised tele-surgery. 
Programming is difficult because human tissue is deformable and highly specular. 
Delegation of lower level control to intelligent systems can potentially make the human-computer nexus outperform the current capabilities of either.</p>

<p>In the recent study using the da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) robotic surgical assistant, we explore a “Learning By Observation” (LBO) approach where we identify, segment, and parameterize sub-trajectories (“surgemes”) and sensor conditions to build a finite state machine (FSM) for each subtask. The robot then executes the FSM repeatedly to tune parameters and if necessary update the FSM structure.</p>

<p>We evaluate the approach on two surgical subtasks: debridement of 3D Viscoelastic Tissue Phantoms (3d-DVTP), in which small target fragments are removed from a 3D viscoelastic tissue phantom, and Pattern Cutting of 2D Orthotropic Tissue Phantoms (2d-PCOTP), a step in the standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training suite, in which a specified circular area must be cut from a sheet of orthotropic tissue phantom.</p>

<p>I am currently studying semi-supervised optimization frameworks for identification of these motions, and performing robust reconstruction of the required trajectories in a new environment.
<br />
The same techniques would in principle be applicable to other high skill tasks like cooking autonomous control.</p>
