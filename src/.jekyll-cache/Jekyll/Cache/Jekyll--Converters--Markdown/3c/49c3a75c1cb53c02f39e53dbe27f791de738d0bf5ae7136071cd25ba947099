At Stanford, I am leading the effort in <em>Rethinking Generalization in Robot Learning</em>. It is a multi-proged effort in developing hierarcical Deep RL abstractions along with learning from video demonstrations.

We are working towards surgical sub-task automation and exploring a data driven approach for reduction in training effort with unsupervised task structure learning. 
<!-- Our recent work includes a '[Learning by Observation](/~garg/files/murali-LBO-2015.pdf)' approach for multilateral cutting, and a [disposable probe](/~garg/research/#learning--automation-in-surgical-subtasks) for RMIS. -->

: **[Brachytherapy for Cancer: Planning and Delivery](/~garg/research/#radiation-therapy-for-cancer-planning-and-delivery)**  
Brachytherapy is an internal form of radiotherapy for cancer, involving radioactive source placement in proximity of the tumor. We have worked on novel patient specific delivery methods for interstitial (e.g. prostate) and intracavitary (e.g. oral/thoracic, GYN) tumors.
