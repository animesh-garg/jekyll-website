<hr />

<p>Brachytherapy is widely used treatment technique for a number of cancer types, namely prostate, gynaecological, oral etc. However it also accompanies a number of side effects as a result of current clinical practice.<br />
<br />
We are exploring shortcomings current methods of treatment planning, procedure and dose delivery techniques. I aim to address these by leveraging advances in robotics, needle steering and rapid prototyping (3D printing).

<p>Recently we have extended the use of 3D printing in customised implants for brachtherapy procedures in gynaecoloical cancers.<br />

<p>In <a href="/~garg/files/garg-brachy-tase-2013.pdf">TASE-2013</a> paper, we have studied use of robot assisted needle implants to improve overall quality of prostate brachytherapy and also as a step towards de-skilling the process. We devised and demonstrated an end-to-end robot assisted brachytherapy treatment delivery system using automated dose and needle planners.
