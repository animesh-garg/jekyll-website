### Other Interests

I am fond of [epic music](http://www.pandora.com/station/1161310246024124702) and movies apart from Indian versions of classical and pop music.  

I have also been improving my culinary skills ever since I started graduate school and like to try [cooking](http://www.indianfoodforever.com/) often.
