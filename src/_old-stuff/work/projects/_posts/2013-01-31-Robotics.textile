h3. Learning from Expert Demonstrations for Surgical Robotics

Surgical tasks,whether robotic or manual, are hard and often long. However automation of frequently repeated sub-tasks in a procedure would improve treatment quality by reducing surgeon fatigue and delegating the repetitive tasks to intelligent systems.

I am currently studying semi-supervised optimization frameworks for identification of these motions, and performing robust reconstruction of the required trajectories in a changed environment than observed before.

The same techniques would in principle be applicable to other high skill tasks like cooking.
