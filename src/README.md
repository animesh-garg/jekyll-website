This repo contains my personal site.

It is uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), please let me know if you have questions.


How to run:
1. Open shell and cd to ./src

2.  jekyll serve
This will fire up a local server at http://localhost:4000 and you may check if your website works.

3. jekyll --base-url "http://www3.decf.berkeley.edu/~agarg"
to generate a website you want to host at a shared hosting service where you can replace your address.
