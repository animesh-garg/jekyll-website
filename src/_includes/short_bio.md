I am a Ph.D student in Robotics and AI at University of California, Berkeley since 2011.  
My home department is [Operations Research][ieor], and I am also pursuing a degree in [Computer Science][cs].   

I am working at the [Berkeley Lab for Automation Science and Engineering][autolab] at UC Berkeley where I am being advised by [Ken Goldberg][kg].  
I also work closely with [Pieter Abbeel][pa] and his group.
Complete list of [collaborators]({{ site.baseurl }}/links/).

*Research Interests*: Optimization (Mixed Integer, Nonlinear), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence in Robotics & Healthcare Applications. 

Primarily, I work in radiation treatment planning and delivery for cancer. We use latest optimization algorithms for creating clinically safe radiaction distributions and devise novel delivery methods like custom 3D printed implants.

One of my long term goal would be to make robots as easy to program and operate as a car. I am also working on skill learning with applications to surgical robotics.
