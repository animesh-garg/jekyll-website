I am a Ph.D student in Robotics and AI at University of California, Berkeley since 2011. My home department is [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research][ieor].   
I am working at the [Berkeley Lab for Automation Science and Engineering][autolab] at UC Berkeley where I am being advised by [Prof. Ken Goldberg][kg]. I also work closely with [Prof. Pieter Abbeel][pa] and his group.

Currently I am working on autonomy in surgical robotics with [Raven-II](http://r2db.tumblr.com/).   
Research Interests: Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Planning and Perception for deformable objects.  
 Learning and Vision are closely entwined with my work.
