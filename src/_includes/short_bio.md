## Welcome!  
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Stanford][cs-stan] working with [Fei-Fei Li][ffl] and [Silvio Savarese][silvio] at [Stanford AI Lab][sail]. I also collaborate closely with [Marco Pavone][marco] and his group. 

My current research focuses on machine learning algorithms for perception and control in robotics. I am specifically interested in enabling self-supervised robot learning and human-robot interaction. 

I received MS in [Computer Science][cs] and Ph.D. in [Operations Research][ieor] from the [UC, Berkeley][ucb] in 2016.  I was advised by [Ken Goldberg][kg] in the [Automation Lab][autolab] as a part of the [Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR)][bair]. I also worked closely with [Pieter Abbeel][pa], [Alper Atamturk][alper] and [UCSF](ucsf) Radiation Oncology. 

**Research Interests**: Machine Learning, Optimization, Design in Robotics & Healthcare.  
<!-- My thesis work was on algorithms at the intersection of Optimization and Design for Automation.  I studied the interaction of data-driven *Learning for Autonomy* and *Design for Automation* for human skill-augmentation and decision support. -->

<!-- Complete list of [collaborators]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/). -->

<!-- I study integration of algorithms with hardware design for applications in medical robotics and healthcare. I aim to develop models for human-machine collaboration, skill-augmentation, semi-supervised autonomy and healthcare decision support.    -->
<!-- My work employs and contributes to techniques in non-convex discrete optimization and representation learning. I envision enabling ease of robot operation by laymen to an extent where the *user manual* becomes unnecessary. 

My research spans *Machine Learning*, *Operations Research*, *Robotics* and *Design*.

<!-- **Research Interests**: Optimization (Mixed Integer, Non-convex), Machine Learning and Design for Automation in Healthcare & Robotics.   -->
