## Welcome!  
I am a Ph.D. student in [Operations Research][ieor] and MS student in [CS][cs] at [Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR)][bair], [UC, Berkeley][ucb].  
I am a member of the [Automation Lab][autolab] advised by [Ken Goldberg][kg] and I also work closely with [Pieter Abbeel][pa], [Alper Atamturk][alper] and [UCSF](ucsf) Radiation Oncology.   
<!-- Complete list of [collaborators]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/). -->

<!-- I study integration of algorithms with hardware design for applications in medical robotics and healthcare. I aim to develop models for human-machine collaboration, skill-augmentation, semi-supervised autonomy and healthcare decision support.    -->
<!-- My work employs and contributes to techniques in non-convex discrete optimization and representation learning. I envision enabling ease of robot operation by laymen to an extent where the *user manual* becomes unnecessary. 
 -->
 
I study the interaction of data-driven *Learning for Autonomy* and *Design for Automation* for human skill-augmentation and decision support. 
My research spans *Operations Research*, *Machine Learning*, *Robotics* and *Design*, combining theory with experiments.   
**Research Interests**: Optimization (Mixed Integer, Non-convex), Machine Learning and Co-Design for Automation in Healthcare & Robotics.
