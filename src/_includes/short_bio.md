## Welcome!  

<!-- ####     ðŸŒŸ <font color="red"> I'm on the faculty job market in Spring 2018! </font> ðŸŒŸ -->


I am currently a senior scientist at [Nvidia Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/) with [Dieter Fox][df].  
I am also a postdoc at [Stanford AI Lab][sail] working with [Fei-Fei Li][ffl] and [Silvio Savarese][silvio] at [Stanford AI Lab][sail].   
I lead the [Stanford People, AI and Robotics (PAIR)][pair-svl] research in the [Vision & Learning][svl] group.
<!-- I also collaborate closely with [Marco Pavone][marco] and his group.  -->

My current research focuses on machine learning algorithms for perception and control in robotics. 
I develop algorithmic methods to enable efficient robot learning for long-term sequential tasks through
Generalizable Autonomy. The principal focus of my research is to understand representations and
algorithms to enable the efficiency and generality of learning for interaction in autonomous agents.

**Research Interests**: Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Optimal Control. I work on
applications of autonomous manipulation in surgical, personal and warehouse robotics.

I received MS in [Computer Science][cs] and Ph.D. in [Operations Research][ieor] from the [UC, Berkeley][ucb] in 2016.  I was advised by [Ken Goldberg][kg] in the [Automation Lab][autolab] as a part of the [Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR)][bair]. I also worked closely with [Pieter Abbeel][pa], [Alper Atamturk][alper] and [UCSF](ucsf) Radiation Oncology. 


<!-- My thesis work was on algorithms at the intersection of Optimization and Design for Automation.  I studied the interaction of data-driven *Learning for Autonomy* and *Design for Automation* for human skill-augmentation and decision support. -->

<!-- Complete list of [collaborators]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/). -->

<!-- I study integration of algorithms with hardware design for applications in medical robotics and healthcare. I aim to develop models for human-machine collaboration, skill-augmentation, semi-supervised autonomy and healthcare decision support.    -->
<!-- My work employs and contributes to techniques in non-convex discrete optimization and representation learning. I envision enabling ease of robot operation by laymen to an extent where the *user manual* becomes unnecessary. 

My research spans *Machine Learning*, *Operations Research*, *Robotics* and *Design*.

<!-- **Research Interests**: Optimization (Mixed Integer, Non-convex), Machine Learning and Design for Automation in Healthcare & Robotics.   -->
