In my Ph.D., I have primarily worked on algorithmic solutions for challenges in:

![surgical]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/images/linearCutProcess-v3.jpg)
: **Learning & Automation in Surgical Subtasks**  
We are working towards surgical sub-task automation and exploring a data driven approach for reduction in training effort with unsupervised task structure learning. Recently, we considered a '[Learning by Observation]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/murali-LBO-2015.pdf)' approach for multilateral cutting, and also presented a [disposable tactile probe]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/#learning--automation-in-surgical-subtasks) for RMIS.

: **Brachytherapy for Cancer: Planning and Delivery**  
Internal form of radiotherapy for cancer treatment, known as Brachytherapy, involves radioactive source placement in proximity to or within the tumor. We have worked on novel treatment planning and patient specific delivery methods for interstitial (e.g. prostate) and intracavitary (e.g. oral/thoracic, GYN) tumors.
