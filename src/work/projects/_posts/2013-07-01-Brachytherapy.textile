h3. Brachytherapy -- Cancer Treatment with Internal Radiation Therapy

Brachytherapy is widely used treatment technique for a number of cancer types, namely prostate, gynaecological, oral etc. However it also accompanies a number of side effects as a result of current clinical practice.  
<br>
I am exploring shortcomings current methods of treatment planning, procedure and dose delivery techniques. I aim to address these by leveraging advances in robotics, needle steering and rapid prototyping (3D printing).

In "TASE-2013":{{ site.baseurl }}/work/files/garg-brachy-tase-2013.pdf paper, we have studied use of robot assisted needle implants to improve overall quality of prostate brachytherapy and also as a step towards de-skilling the process. We devised and demonstrated an end-to-end robot assisted brachytherapy treatment delivery system using automated dose and needle planners.

More recently we have extended the use of 3D printing in customised implants for brachtherapy procedures in gynaecoloical cancers. Details in "CASE-2013":{{ site.baseurl }}/work/files/garg-case2013-custom_3DP_Implants.pdf paper.
