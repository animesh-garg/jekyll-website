I want to solve some of the open problems in AI, particularly for robotics. I am interested in optimization and machine learning applications for robotics & healthcare applications. 

Primarily, I work in radiation treatment planning and delivery for cancer. We use latest optimization algorithms for creating clinically safe radiaction distributions and devise novel delivery methods like custom 3D printed implants.

One of my long term goal would be to make robots as easy to program and operate as a car. I am also working on skill learning with applications to surgical robotics.

Please [email me](mailto:animesh.garg@berkeley.edu) for a pdf version of latest CV.
