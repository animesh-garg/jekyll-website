I want to solve some of the open problems in AI, particularly for robotics. I am interested in vision and machine learning applications for robotics. My long term goal would be to make robots as easy to program and operate as a car.  
Currently I am working on autonomy in surgical robotics with [Raven-II](http://r2db.tumblr.com/).
