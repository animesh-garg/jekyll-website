## Surveying Related Work and Background in Academic Papers

Really need to check if problem is solved!
Makes the job easier for reviewer
Also in the small world of research peer review, making the mistake to not properly attribute the recent developments may upset some reviewers. 
Not only a citation is required but a understanding of the work/technique is needed to qualify the novelty of proposed work. 

Given the limited real-estate of conference papers, a fairly accepted approach is to group related work into sub-topics and differentiate your work from the underlying approach of each group. 

It is beneficial to perform detailed related work surveys:
- not miss existing developments
- use the accepted jargon/terminology in the community.
- use this as an oppotunity to evaluate your approach against existing works instead of stating your results as is. Baselines dont have to be really bad to make you look good!

-Should not miss key-*bases* of the sub-sub-topic. 
-Find key paper(s). 
	Look for more recent ones. 
	Look for Top journal papers: will have thorough related work and background. 
-Use 'Cited BY' tool with the Google Scholar search. 
- Look for surveys, preefrably recent.
- Actually *read* some of these papers, and look for key seminal works which are cited repeatedly. 
-Identify Key *Players* in the sub-sub-topic. 
	Look at their google scholar profiles and webpages for recent works.
