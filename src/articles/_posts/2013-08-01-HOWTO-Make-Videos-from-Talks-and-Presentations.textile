h2. HOWTO Make Videos from Talks and Presentations (Still-in-progress)

Disseminating research in a comprehensive manner is a matter of great importance, more
so today with easy access to similar work and information overload. Very often, I have
myself abandoned reading many papers for the lack of either: clarity in writing, absence
of supporting material or no reproducible results.

I am making a small step towards personal corrective action by writing this tutorial on
how to record videos in Powerpoint for your talks. I am going to provide a bare bones
method because I think it has low potential barrier (so no more excuses!) and it would
perhaps take only 10 minutes of work over and above the time of the talk.

Make your slides and open them in Powerpoint.
