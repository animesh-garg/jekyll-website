### **CoRL and ISRR Submissions**

We submitted an exciting new line of work on policy transfer --  "AdaPT: Zero-Shot Adaptive Policy Transfer for Stochastic Dynamical Systems" to [ISRR 2017](https://parasol.tamu.edu/isrr/isrr2017/). 

We also submitted three papers to [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)](www.robot-learning.org), 2017.

Check out the [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications.html) for public drafts.  
Please feel free to send me an email with comments and suggestions. 

Check back after **Aug 31** for final version of the paper.
