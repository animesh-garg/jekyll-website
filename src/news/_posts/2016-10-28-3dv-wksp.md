### **Understanding 3D and Visuo-Motor Learning at [3DV 2016](http://3dv.stanford.edu/)**

[Chris Choy](http://chrischoy.github.io/) and I recently organized the   [Understanding 3D and Visuo-Motor Learning](http://3dv.stanford.edu/visuo-motor/) at the [International Conference on 3D Vision](http://3dv.stanford.edu/). 

The workshop and talks focused on navigation, affordance, manipulation and other robotics application. It was a successful discussion between researchers in 3D vision, robotics and computer vision at large on problems where robotics would benefit from!
